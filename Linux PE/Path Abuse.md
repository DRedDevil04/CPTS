```shell
echo $PATH
```

Adding `.` to a user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example, if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as `ls` with a malicious script such as a reverse shell. If we add `.` to the path by issuing the command `PATH=.:$PATH` and then `export PATH`, we will be able to run binaries located in our current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just typing `ls` will call the malicious script named `ls` in the current working directory instead of the binary located at `/bin/ls`).

```shell
PATH=.:${PATH}
```
```shell
export PATH
```
