Cron jobs can also be set to run one time (such as on boot). They are typically used for administrative tasks such as running backups, cleaning up directories, etc. The `crontab` command can create a cron file, which will be run by the cron daemon on the schedule specified. When created, the cron file will be created in `/var/spool/cron` for the specific user that creates it. Each entry in the crontab file requires six items in the following order: minutes, hours, days, months, weeks, commands. For example, the entry `0 */12 * * * /home/admin/backup.sh` would run every 12 hours.

```shell
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```

We can confirm that a cron job is running using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy), a command-line tool used to view running processes without the need for root privileges. We can use it to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. It works by scanning [procfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs).

Let's run `pspy` and have a look. The `-pf` flag tells the tool to print commands and file system events and `-i 1000` tells it to scan [procfs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html) every 1000ms (or every second).

```shell
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000
```
