Pivoting is essentially the idea ofÂ `moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments`.

- `Pivot Host`
- `Proxy`
- `Foothold`
- `Beach Head system`
- `Jump Host`

`Tunneling`, on the other hand, is a subset of pivoting. Tunneling encapsulates network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through it.
