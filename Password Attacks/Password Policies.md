A [password policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy) is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them adequately based on the company's definition.

The scope of a password policy is not limited to the password minimum requirements but the whole life cycle of a password (such as manipulation, storage, and transmission).
