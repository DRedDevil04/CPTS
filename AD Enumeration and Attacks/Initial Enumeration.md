### Identifying Hosts

- Wireshark and tcpdump


Discover hosts and IPs

Responder :

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison `LLMNR`, `NBT-NS`, and `MDNS` requests and responses. It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets.

```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 -A 
```

fping : 

[Fping](https://fping.org/) provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a host. Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. Also, it works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving on. These checks will help us determine if anything else is active on the internal network. ICMP is not a one-stop-shop, but it is an easy way to get an initial idea of what exists. Other open ports and active protocols may point to new hosts for later targeting


```shell-session
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

`fping` with a few flags: `a` to show targets that are alive, `s` to print stats at the end of the scan, `g` to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and `q` to not show per-target results.

```bash
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum
```

 Identify critical hosts such as `Domain Controllers` and `web servers`, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. With our focus on AD, after doing a broad sweep, it would be wise of us to focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few.
 
```bash
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum
```

`-oA` flag as a best practice when performing Nmap scans. This will ensure that we have our scan results in several formats for logging purposes and formats that can be manipulated and fed into other tools.

### Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration

[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the `jsmith.txt` or `jsmith2.txt` user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective

The tool is quick, and we will be provided with results letting us know if the accounts found are valid or not, which is a great starting point for launching attacks such as password spraying

#### Installation

```shell-session
sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git
```

```shell-session
make help
```

```shell-session
sudo make all
```

```shell-session
ls dist/
```

Add to $PATH

```shell-session
echo $PATH
/home/htb-student/.local/bin:/snap/bin:/usr/sandbox/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/usr/share/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/snap/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/home/htb-student/.dotnet/tools
```

```shell-session
sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute
```

#### Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

```shell-session

kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users
```

## Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities

The [local system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account) account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services. It is also very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A `SYSTEM` account on a `domain-joined` host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account, which is essentially just another kind of user account. Having SYSTEM-level access within a domain environment is nearly equivalent to having a domain user account.

- Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
- Abusing a service running in the context of the `SYSTEM account`, or abusing the service account `SeImpersonate` privileges using [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato). This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
- Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.
- Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using Psexec to launch a SYSTEM cmd window

By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:

- Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
- Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
- Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
- Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
- Carry out ACL attacks.nmap
