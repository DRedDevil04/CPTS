## Input Filters

[PHP Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.php) are a type of PHP wrappers, where we can pass different types of input and have it filtered by the filter we specify. To use PHP wrapper streams, we can use the `php://` scheme in our string, and we can access the PHP filter wrapper with `php://filter/`.

There are four different types of filters available for use, which are [String Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.string.php), [Conversion Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php), [Compression Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.compression.php), and [Encryption Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.encryption.php). You can read more about each filter on their respective link, but the filter that is useful for LFI attacks is the `convert.base64-encode` filter, under `Conversion Filters`.

## Fuzzing for PHP Files

The first step would be to fuzz for different available PHP pages with a tool like `ffuf` or `gobuster`, as covered in the [Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/54) module:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ.php
```

 Unlike normal web application usage, we are not restricted to pages with HTTP response code 200, as we have local file inclusion access, so we should be scanning for all codes, including `301`, `302` and `403` pages, and we should be able to read their source code as well.

## Standard PHP Inclusion

The same applies to web application languages other than PHP, as long as the vulnerable function can execute files. Otherwise, we would directly get the source code, and would not need to use extra filters/functions to read the source code. Refer to the functions table in section 1 to see which functions have which privileges.

## Source Code Disclosure

Once we have a list of potential PHP files we want to read, we can start disclosing their sources with the `base64` PHP filter. Let's try to read the source code of `config.php` using the base64 filter, by specifying `convert.base64-encode` for the `read` parameter and `config` for the `resource` parameter, as follows:

```url
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```

```shell
echo 'PD9waHAK...SNIP...KICB9Ciov' | base64 -d
```
