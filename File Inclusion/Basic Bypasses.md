## Non-Recursive Path Traversal Filters

```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```

However, this filter is very insecure, as it is not `recursively removing` the `../` substring, as it runs a single time on the input string and does not apply the filter on the output string
 For example, if we use `....//` as our payload, then the filter would remove `../` and the output string would be `../`, which means we may still perform path traversal. Let's try applying this logic to include `/etc/passwd` again:

## Encoding

Some web filters may prevent input filters that include certain LFI-related characters, like a dot `.` or a slash `/` used for path traversals. However, some of these filters may be bypassed by URL encoding our input, such that it would no longer include these bad characters, but would still be decoded back to our path traversal string once it reaches the vulnerable function. Core PHP filters on versions 5.3.4 and earlier were specifically vulnerable to this bypass, but even on newer versions we may find custom filters that may be bypassed through URL encoding.

## Approved Paths

Some web applications may also use Regular Expressions to ensure that the file being included is under a specific path. For example, the web application we have been dealing with may only accept paths that are under the `./languages` directory, as follows:

```php

if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```

To find the approved path, we can examine the requests sent by the existing forms, and see what path they use for the normal web functionality. Furthermore, we can fuzz web directories under the same path, and try different ones until we get a match. To bypass this, we may use path traversal and start our payload with the approved path, and then use `../` to go back to the root directory and read the file we specify, as follows:

## Appended Extension

As discussed in the previous section, some web applications append an extension to our input string (e.g. `.php`), to ensure that the file we include is in the expected extension. With modern versions of PHP, we may not be able to bypass this and will be restricted to only reading files in that extension, which may still be useful, as we will see in the next section (e.g. for reading source code).

There are a couple of other techniques we may use, but they are `obsolete with modern versions of PHP and only work with PHP versions before 5.3/5.4`

#### Path Truncation

In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters, likely due to the limitation of 32-bit systems. If a longer string is passed, it will simply be `truncated`, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored. Furthermore, PHP also used to remove trailing slashes and single dots in path names, so if we call (`/etc/passwd/.`) then the `/.` would also be truncated, and PHP would call (`/etc/passwd`). PHP, and Linux systems in general, also disregard multiple slashes in the path (e.g. `////etc/passwd` is the same as `/etc/passwd`). Similarly, a current directory shortcut (`.`) in the middle of the path would also be disregarded (e.g. `/etc/./passwd`).
Finally, it is also important to note that we would also need to `start the path with a non-existing directory` for this technique to work.

```shell-session

echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
```

#### Null Bytes

PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to `null byte injection`, which means that adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it. This is due to how strings are stored in low-level memory, where strings in memory must use a null byte to indicate the end of the string, as seen in Assembly, C, or C++ languages.

To exploit this vulnerability, we can end our payload with a null byte (e.g. `/etc/passwd%00`), such that the final path passed to `include()` would be (`/etc/passwd%00.php`). This way, even though `.php` is appended to our string, anything after the null byte would be truncated, and so the path used would actually be `/etc/passwd`, leading us to bypass the appended extension.
