`Reflected XSS` vulnerabilities occur when our input reaches the back-end server and gets returned to us without being filtered or sanitized. There are many cases in which our entire input might get returned to us, like error messages or confirmation messages. In these cases, we may attempt using XSS payloads to see whether they execute. However, as these are usually temporary messages, once we move from the page, they would not execute again, and hence they are `Non-Persistent`.

`But if the XSS vulnerability is Non-Persistent, how would we target victims with it?`

This depends on which HTTP request is used to send our input to the server. We can check this through the Firefox `Developer Tools` by clicking [`CTRL+Shift+I`] and selecting the `Network` tab. Then, we can put our `test` payload again and click `Add` to send it:

As we can see, the first row shows that our request was a `GET` request. `GET` request sends their parameters and data as part of the URL. So, `to target a user, we can send them a URL containing our payload`.
