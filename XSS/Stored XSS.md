## XSS Testing Payloads

We can test whether the page is vulnerable to XSS with the following basic XSS payload:

Code: html

```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```

We use this payload as it is a very easy-to-spot method to know when our XSS payload has been successfully executed. Suppose the page allows any input and does not perform any sanitization on it. In that case, the alert should pop up with the URL of the page it is being executed on, directly after we input our payload or when we refresh the page:

Many modern web applications utilize cross-domain IFrames to handle user input, so that even if the web form is vulnerable to XSS, it would not be a vulnerability on the main web application. This is why we are showing the value of `window.origin` in the alert box, instead of a static value like `1`. In this case, the alert box would reveal the URL it is being executed on, and will confirm which form is the vulnerable one, in case an IFrame was being used.

As some modern browsers may block the `alert()` JavaScript function in specific locations, it may be handy to know a few other basic XSS payloads to verify the existence of XSS. One such XSS payload is `<plaintext>`, which will stop rendering the HTML code that comes after it and display it as plaintext. Another easy-to-spot payload is `<script>print()</script>` that will pop up the browser print dialog, which is unlikely to be blocked by any browsers. Try using these payloads to see how each works. You may use the reset button to remove any current payloads.
