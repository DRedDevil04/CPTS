- `Length`: The longer the password, the better. Aim for a minimum of 12 characters, but longer is always preferable. The reasoning is simple: each additional character in a password dramatically increases the number of possible combinations. For instance, a 6-character password using only lowercase letters has 26^6 (approximately 300 million) possible combinations. In contrast, an 8-character password has 26^8 (approximately 200 billion) combinations. This exponential increase in possibilities makes longer passwords significantly more resistant to brute-force attacks.
    
- `Complexity`: Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid quickly guessable patterns or sequences. Including different character types expands the pool of potential characters for each position in the password. For example, a password using only lowercase letters has 26 possibilities per character, while a password using both uppercase and lowercase letters has 52 possibilities per character. This increased complexity makes it much harder for attackers to predict or guess passwords.
    
- `Uniqueness`: Don't reuse passwords across different accounts. Each account should have its own unique and strong password. If one account is compromised, all other accounts using the same password are also at risk. By using unique passwords for each account, you compartmentalize the potential damage of a breach.
    
- `Randomness`: Avoid using dictionary words, personal information, or common phrases. The more random the password, the harder it is to crack. Attackers often use wordlists containing common passwords and personal information to speed up their brute-force attempts. Creating a random password minimizes the chances of being included in such wordlists.

## Common Password Weaknesses

Despite the importance of strong passwords, many users still rely on weak and easily guessable passwords. Common weaknesses include:

- `Short Passwords`: Passwords with fewer than eight characters are particularly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, as the number of possible combinations is relatively small.
- `Common Words and Phrases`: Using dictionary words, names, or common phrases as passwords makes them susceptible to dictionary attacks, where attackers try a pre-defined list of common passwords.
- `Personal Information`: Incorporating personal information like birthdates, pet names, or addresses into passwords makes them easier to guess, especially if this information is publicly available on social media or other online platforms.
- `Reusing Passwords`: Using the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is compromised, all other accounts using the same password are also at risk.
- `Predictable Patterns`: Using patterns like "qwerty" or "123456" or simple substitutions like "p@ssw0rd" makes passwords easy to guess, as these patterns are well-known to attackers.

## Password Policies

Organizations often implement password policies to enforce the use of strong passwords. These policies typically include requirements for:

- `Minimum Length`: The minimum number of characters a password must have.
- `Complexity`: The types of characters that must be included in a password (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
- `Password Expiration`: The frequency with which passwords must be changed.
- `Password History`: The number of previous passwords that cannot be reused.
