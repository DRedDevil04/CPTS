The success of a brute force attack depends on several factors, including:

- The `complexity` of the password or key. Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are exponentially more complex to crack.
- The `computational power` available to the attacker. Modern computers and specialized hardware can try billions of combinations per second, significantly reducing the time needed for a successful attack.
- The `security measures` in place. Account lockouts, CAPTCHAs, and other defenses can slow down or even thwart brute-force attempts.
