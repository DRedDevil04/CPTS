## Mitigating Issues

disable the `Ping the remote host`

In sensitive networks, we can use rate-limiting to minimize impact. For example, we can adjust `Performance Options` and modify `Max Concurrent Checks Per Host` if the target host is often under heavy load, such as a widely used web application. This will limit the number of plugins used concurrently against the host.
can avoid scanning legacy systems and choose the option not to scan printers

`nessusd.rules` file to configure Nessus scans. More information about it you can find [here](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-the-Nessus-rules-file?language=en_US).

never perform [Denial of Service checks](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/families/Denial%20of%20Service). We can ensure that these types of plugins are not used by always enabling the ["safe checks"](https://www.tenable.com/blog/understanding-the-nessus-safe-checks-option) option

## Network Impact

It is also essential to keep in mind the potential impact of vulnerability scanning on a network, especially on low bandwidth or congested links. This can be measured using [vnstat](https://humdi.net/vnstat/):

```shell-session
sudo apt install vnstat
```

```shell-session
sudo vnstat -l -i eth0
```
