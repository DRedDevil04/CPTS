So far, we have only been dealing with type filters that only consider the file extension in the file name. However, as we saw in the previous section, we may still be able to gain control over the back-end server even with image extensions (e.g. `shell.php.jpg`). Furthermore, we may utilize some allowed extensions (e.g., SVG) to perform other attacks. All of this indicates that only testing the file extension is not enough to prevent file upload attacks.

This is why many modern web servers and web applications also test the content of the uploaded file to ensure it matches the specified type. While extension filters may accept several extensions, content filters usually specify a single category (e.g., images, videos, documents), which is why they do not typically use blacklists or whitelists. This is because web servers provide functions to check for the file content type, and it usually falls under a specific category.

There are two common methods for validating the file content: `Content-Type Header` or `File Content`. Let's see how we can identify each filter and how to bypass both of them.

```php
$type = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];

if (!in_array($type, array('image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'))) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```

The code sets the (`$type`) variable from the uploaded file's `Content-Type` header. Our browsers automatically set the Content-Type header when selecting a file through the file selector dialog, usually derived from the file extension. However, since our browsers set this, this operation is a client-side operation, and we can manipulate it to change the perceived file type and potentially bypass the type filter.

We may start by fuzzing the Content-Type header with SecLists' [Content-Type Wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-all-content-types.txt) through Burp Intruder, to see which types are allowed. However, the message tells us that only images are allowed, so we can limit our scan to image types, which reduces the wordlist to `45` types only (compared to around 700 originally). We can do so as follows:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-all-content-types.txt
```

```shell
cat web-all-content-types.txt | grep 'image/' > image-content-types.txt
```

Try to run the above scan to find what Content-Types are allowed.

A file upload HTTP request has two Content-Type headers, one for the attached file (at the bottom), and one for the full request (at the top). We usually need to modify the file's Content-Type header, but in some cases the request will only contain the main Content-Type header (e.g. if the uploaded content was sent as `POST` data), in which case we will need to modify the main Content-Type header.

## MIME-Type

The second and more common type of file content validation is testing the uploaded file's `MIME-Type`. `Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)` is an internet standard that determines the type of a file through its general format and bytes structure.

This is usually done by inspecting the first few bytes of the file's content, which contain the [File Signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) or [Magic Bytes](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522030920/https://opensource.apple.com/source/file/file-23/file/magic/magic.mime). For example, if a file starts with (`GIF87a` or `GIF89a`), this indicates that it is a `GIF` image, while a file starting with plaintext is usually considered a `Text` file. If we change the first bytes of any file to the GIF magic bytes, its MIME type would be changed to a GIF image, regardless of its remaining content or extension.

Many other image types have non-printable bytes for their file signatures, while a `GIF` image starts with ASCII printable bytes (as shown above), so it is the easiest to imitate. Furthermore, as the string `GIF8` is common between both GIF signatures, it is usually enough to imitate a GIF image.

The `file` command on Unix systems finds the file type through the MIME type.

```php
$type = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);

if (!in_array($type, array('image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'))) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```

Once we forward our request, we notice that we get the error message `Only images are allowed`. Now, let's try to add `GIF8` before our PHP code to try to imitate a GIF image while keeping our file extension as `.php`, so it would execute PHP code regardless:

This time we get `File successfully uploaded`, and our file is successfully uploaded to the server

We can use a combination of the two methods discussed in this section, which may help us bypass some more robust content filters. For example, we can try using an `Allowed MIME type with a disallowed Content-Type`, an `Allowed MIME/Content-Type with a disallowed extension`, or a `Disallowed MIME/Content-Type with an allowed extension`, and so on. Similarly, we can attempt other combinations and permutations to try to confuse the web server, and depending on the level of code security, we may be able to bypass various filters.
